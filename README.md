# Google Sheets â†’ Calendar Connector

A simple Node.JS application that uses REST APIs to update a Google calendar based on data from a Google sheet.

It was written for a very specific use case (that of a spreadsheet used to track availability of volunteers for a code club) so it's unlikely to be generally useful, but it can hopefully serve as a reference or starting-point for anyone looking to do something similar.

### Setup ###

Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

Follow the linked instructions to enable both the [Google Calendar](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/quickstart/nodejs) and [Google Sheets](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/nodejs) APIs, including replacing the `client_secret.json` file with your own client secret.

Edit [environment.ts](src/environment/environment.ts) to configure the locations of your Google calendar and spreadsheet
and other aspects of the application.

Tested on node 10.3.0.

### Run once ###

* `npm run start` - update the calendar with data from the spreadsheet
* `npm run dry-run` - log the updates that would have been made, without actually making them

The first time you run the application it will prompt you to visit a web site to authenticate - simply follow the instructions
in the console.  The credentials are save to disk and re-used for future runs.

### Run on a schedule ###

The application does not provide support for scheduling - use an OS provided system such as `cron` (linux) or `launchd` (MacOS).

### Docker ###

##### Build #####

    docker build -t google-sheets-calendar-connector .
    docker volume create google-api-token
    docker create -i -v google-api-token:/var/token --name google-sheets-calendar-connector google-sheets-calendar-connector

##### First run #####

    docker start -i google-sheets-calendar-connector

Follow the instructions to authenticate and then press `Ctrl+D` to stop the container.

##### Subsequent runs #####

    docker start google-sheets-calendar-connector

The application will run once and the container will stop  on completion.
